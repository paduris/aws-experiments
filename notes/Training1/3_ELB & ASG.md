**EC2 Load Balancer**

 * Health Checks 
 

 Types of load balancer on AWS
 
 * **Classic load balancer**
 
 
 
 * **Application load balancer - (V2, Layer 7)** 
    * Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
    * Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine ( ex: containers)
    * Load balancing based on the route in the URL
    * Load balancing based on the hostname in the URL
    * They are very good fit for Micro services architecture (Ex: Amazon ECS)
    * Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port 
    * Stickiness can be enabled at the target group level
        * Same request goes to the same instance
        * Stickiness is directly generated by ALB (not the application)
        * ALB supports Http/Https/Web sockets protocols
        * The application servers don't see the IP of the client directly.
        
 * **Network Load Balancer**

 * **Load Balancer Stickiness**
    * Same client is always redirected to same instance behind a load balancer
    * The "cookie" is used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
    * **Use-Case** - make sure the user doesn't lose his session data
    * Enabling stickiness would bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances
    
    
**Exam Notes**
    * No cross Zone load balancing
